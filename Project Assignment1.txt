Limit Your Time

Do not spend lots of time on this project after class hours.  Outside class focus on your passion project.

Please remember:
•	Commit your changes in frequently and get fresh builds from GitHub frequently.
•	Start every new coding session with a fresh build.
•	In addition to storing your code on github store it locally on your machine as a backup. 

To do this delete the git folder inside your local project folder to remove it from GitHub. 
Then place your project in a time stamped folder like 2018_1212_1352_myproj. Then zip it.
